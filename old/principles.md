# Principles that guide my life

Here are a few principles that I live by which I have put an immense amount
of thought into. Just because a principle is not on this list, does not 
mean that I do not abide by it. This list is ordered. 

0) Nothing on this list can be achieved without hard work.
1) Relentless learning and self improvement. "The days are long, but the decades are short".
2) Step out of your comfort zone. For everything that you do, every single day.
3) Surround yourself with amazing, incredible people. This will pay off in unimaginable ways.
4) Everyday: be kind, sleep well, eat well, exercise well.

# Gaming

Gaming is evil! At least that's what I want to say. I've had a lot of opinions on this topic
throughout the years, usually just bouncing around from 'gaming is good' to
'gaming is bad'. Personally, I have played my fair share of games - I've had
whole days where I just sat and played games. However, I wouldn't say I had a gaming
addiction since I only played on off-days such as school holidays and I was always
able to do what needed to be done.

However today, you will hear my argument on why gaming is a bad thing. First of all,
I will define gaming as strictly video games - board games such as chess, monopoly,
codenames or whatever don't count, because they are either much less addictive, or
they are social 'games' which I perceive to offset the downside.

I also know there is a huge camp of people which are firm believers of 'time you 
enjoy wasting is not wasted time'. I used to be one of these people, but I am
leaning toward the idea I was just making excuses for my past habit of gaming.
My general perspective is: enjoyment alone
is not really enough to justify an activity. I put gaming in the same category as
drinking alcohol, or having fast food. They are generally unhealthy activities (the
latter for your body, the former for your mind), and sure it may be fine to do
once in a while, but you're probably better off quitting in general.

I think the big argument for me is definitely opportunity cost - instead of gaming,
there are many things one can do, especially since gaming is a fairly time consuming
hobby. You could go for a walk, talk with family and friends, go outside play some sport,
learn a new skill, practice a hobby - even creating a game is much better spend of time!
These are also enjoyable, but have tangible benefits towards your life as well, whether
physically or socially. A big gripe I have with things like watching TV/movies is that
unless it was a truly standout movie (which can be an exception), it will be something
just forgotten in a day to a month. It won't really contribute to your life, and it's
as if that time just vanished. Same goes for scrolling social media. And same goes for
gaming - if you have ever played a competitive FPS game, there is a good chance that
99% of matches you have played are gone from your memory except for the standout
matches where you performed very well, for example. When I look back, I sometimes wonder
how crazy I would be at basketball, or even math, if I exchanged my gaming time to
hone my skills (which obviously is unrealistic, but even 50% of the exchange would already
be a significant change). There's a lot more arguments along these lines, but I think
you understand the general idea. I want to spend my life working hard, improving every
aspect of myself and being a good person. Gaming is something that takes time away
from these goals.

From this whole article (and my blog), it is easy to tell that I am someone who
cares a lot about being productive (god forbid...), but I really don't like
driving the argument towards that. I genuinely don't think that "oh we need to be
so productive every second of the day", because it is important to take time and
relax - living like that is very stressful. I do think being efficient with your
actions is important - so the time spent studying, for example, should be spent
studying and having your mind wander off to something else, going on a long detour
and coming back to studying is a waste of time. 

This is where I think gaming is a bit of a problem. This is purely anecdotal, and
I have no idea if it's the same for other people (but as long as it's real for me
then that's good enough technically), but gaming also takes a lot more time than
the physical act of gaming. For a surface level argument - gaming is tiring. It
is much easier to study for 8 hours, then game for 8 hours instead of game for
8 hours, then study for 8 hours. I believe it's because video games are inherently
a very dopaminergic activity - and game developers, as with social media developers,
spend much of their time trying to make their game as addictive as possible - to
obviously drive revenue. It saps away at a lot of energy, and if you must game, it
is probably best to do it late at night when you are already tired. 

My most pressing issue with gaming is that, shortly after a gaming session, my mind
is very often buzzing with games. I'm thinking of new strategies, or things that
I want to try in my next session. And it's purely with gaming that these sort of
thoughts pop up. Sure, if I play chess, I may have thoughts along these lines for
a while, but they much less intrude on the tasks I am doing. Perhaps I am studying,
and suddenly (for god knows what reason), I have an urge to go play some games - 
and it requires some sort of willpower to bring myself back. And using that willpower
does exert some energy, and makes studying much more difficult than it should be.
I think the solution for this is along the lines of meditation and embracing boredom,
but I'll leave these topics for another day. But my concern is that gaming takes prime
real estate in my brain, real estate I would much rather give to something more deserving.

Anyways, I think I wrote too much - so I'll end it here. I know I wrote an entire
character assassination on gaming, but I don't actually *hate* gaming. I actually really
enjoy gaming - I'd argue some of the best times of my life were actually spent inside
a game (both multiplayer and singleplayer games). However, it's just coming to a point
where I'm starting to understand the value of time, and the fact that life is short.
I have an extremely long list of things I want to achieve, so naturally I have to
elminate every distraction down to the last one, which means gaming is something
I need to part with. This article is not meant to try convince every person who reads
it to stop gaming, but to provide a perspective. I think gaming can definitely be
a great hobby, but in a very certain context.

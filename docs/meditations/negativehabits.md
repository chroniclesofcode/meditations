# Negative Habits

We all know the importance of forming good habits. Just as many grains of sand
make up a beach, your character, identity and life is made up of all the habits
you have ingrained in yourself. It is important to take time each day to
cultivate these habits so that they remain a habit.

However, it is just as important to cut out the small, negative habits - which
erode the work that you have built, and cut away at the progress you are making.
Take some time each day to not only practice the good habits, but to also take
a moment to observe the small habits that contribute to your life negatively.

Examples may include low-hanging fruit such as procrastination and watching youtube.
But more subtle examples might include: what you do first thing in the morning - do
you check social media? Or even what you are doing when eating a meal -
do you have a conversation with family? Or browse on your phone? 

One that I've noticed recently for myself is: how I am taking breaks in between work
periods. I used to enjoy something fairly dopaminergic, such as browsing social media, or watching
a 20-minute episode of a show. But now I've been taking some time to rest, gather my
thoughts and have a restful rest. Sometimes I'll take a walk outside and take in the
fresh air and nature as well.

Each small step, each tiny change, contributes to a greater transformation - one that leads to a more fulfilling, intentional life.

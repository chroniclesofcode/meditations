title: Butterfly Dreams
---

> Once upon a time, I dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was myself. Soon I awaked, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man.

This is a quote from the book Zhuangzi, an ancient Chinese text that is not only one of the
great Daoist texts, but also of Chinese literature.

Often when reading books, I like to transpose the philosophy of these books into the context of my own life, and
my own philosophies. Not obvious from first glance, I interpret this quote as referring to the different stages
of understanding one can achieve of the Dao, despite it seeming like fun abstract thought experiment on 'what is reality?' akin to 'Are we living in a simulation?'. So in
the beginning, we all start off as butterflies, a more primitive lifeform - and as we gain understanding
of higher order rules - rules of the world - we will 'wake up' from this dream, and realise that we
were a human dreaming of a butterfly. You were living in this world the entire time, yet oblivious to
how the world really is. I am sure a butterfly does not know of money and mathematics.

I liken this concept to programming, and mastery of skills in general. It is similar to the saying
"For every step we take, we are two steps further from our destination". The more understanding of
programming we get, the more we realise there is so much more to be learnt. The more we realise our
systems can be designed better. The faster we can make our algorithms. You are at your strongest
when you acknowledge you are the weakest. That is why Jigoro Kano, the founder of Judo, was
asked to be buried in his white belt. I only hope that I can someday wake up and realise I was dreaming
as a butterfly.

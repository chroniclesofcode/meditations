# The 5AM Club

I am person who loves observing other people and learning from them. I especially
like to study the habits of the few great people who have made an impact upon this
world we live in. And I have consistently noticed that many incredibly successful
people wake up early. For some context, I am not an early riser - in fact, I struggle
to wake earlier than 8am. Because of this, I have always been somewhat sceptical
of the supposed benefits of early rising - or perhaps I didn't want to believe it 
since I am not an early riser myself. However, studies show that early risers tend
to perform better academically, as well as having high levels of physical and mental
health. There are also better workplace outcomes, but I won't go too in depth on these matters.

I am sure part of these results are because of our societal structure - a 9-5 job
dictates that those who have energy early in the morning perhaps have an advantage.
But I think from a more 'common sense' standpoint this is also true - in the morning,
we have higher levels of dopamine and self-control. We also get exposed to sunlight
for longer, keeping our alertness levels awake. Perhaps when the sun goes down, our
natural body tends to quieten down as well, since we are preparing for sleep.
I haven't looked too much deeper into the studies, but all I can say for sure is - if I wake earlier, 
life can only get better.

I am also not much of a believer in the early bird and night owl. Some people are avid
believers in the different sleep chronotypes - but I have changed my sleep schedule
dramatically throughout my life, with little to no difference at all. In high-school I believed
I was an early-bird, rising at around 6am every morning. But in university, I woke
regularly at noon! And when I started working a 9-5, I gradually woke at 7:30-8am. 
The transition periods were definitely uncomfortable - I truly believed I was not built
to wake early during my university days - but once I got used to my
schedule - my alertness and productivity levels have not changed much, at least
from a subjective standpoint. If I had to examine myself under a microscope, perhaps
my high-school days were the most productive - I really got a lot done back then.
But it is hard to say whether that was because of the school system or my early mornings. But
I do attribute some of my high-school results to the fact I arrived at school before 8am everyday
and did an hour of study before class started at 9. These hours really do add up, surprisingly.

So why do people not wake early? Simply... because it's hard. Night time is all about
relaxing, and it's hard to stop relaxing when your day time has been busy and stressful.
I'll stop my stream-of-consciousness here - I just wanted to write a bit on early mornings and
perhaps give you, the reader, a little nudge (and myself!).
I think it's something many people aspire towards, but few people actually have the commitment
to do it - maybe because we don't truly believe in the benefits. I think I'll start waking
earlier from now on. And perhaps this day will be the starting point of great achievements to come.

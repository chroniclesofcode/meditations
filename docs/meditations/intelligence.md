# Intelligence

When I first started writing this blog, I promised myself I wouldn't make an entry
on intelligence because it's such a divisive topic, and anything that doesn't repeat
the well-known studies on intelligence will be looked down upon. However, I have an
interesting theory that may or may not be correct, but it is how I view one of the
many different facets of intelligence. Of course, since I am a computer scientist,
I am more curious about the algorithmic/logical thinking types of intelligence, so
bear that in mind.

I'll cut straight to the chase: I think improving intelligence is a matter of
breadth and depth. There is a Goldilock's zone for this: too much depth makes you
unable to make connections between different fields, and too much breadth makes
you unable to think about problems on a complex level. I think 99% of the population
doesn't have enough breadth in their work, and that is why it's observed that
intelligence seems to remain stagnant after a certain age. People entering the workforce
tend to not entertain breadth as much, and instead focus entirely on what their
occupation requires. Years of education are deeply correlated with intelligence:
and for good reason - where else can you learn such a variety of different subjects,
at an in-depth level in such a short time? Especially at university, I am juggling
an extremely large variety of different CS and Math courses per year, from linear algebra,
to C++ systems to Javascript frontends. Now, let me backtrack and elaborate from the beginning.

I've always been fairly good at sports when I was younger - especially sports I've
never played before - I was actually pretty good at them from the get-go. In other
words, I would say that I had a high "sports-intelligence" - and I attribute that
to the fact that I've just played tons and tons of sports when I was younger such as
basketball, squash, table-tennis, tennis, soccer, baseball, running, swimming, volleyball,
oz-tag - and for each one I have invested at least 100 hours, and thousands for my
favourites. And I was pretty good when I was playing sports which were considered
fairly different to the above. And you may be thinking: that's obvious - a lot of sports
share similar techniques, such as racket-handling, or agility, or throwing a ball.
And that's exactly the point I want to make.

Just as person who have learnt a lot of different 'techniques' from learning sports,
I believe the same is for algorithmic thinking. Someone who has learnt and implemented
tons and tons of algorithms is going to pick up and apply new algorithms better than
people who are an expert in a select few. The common discourse in competitive programming is: 
to reach a certain "low" rank, one must focus on the fundamental algorithms deeply since
all the problems are just applications of it: think binary search, dp, graph, factorizations.
So tons of newbies set out and only solve problems in a confined context. I used to think the
same. But now, I think people who are trying to improve must learn new algorithms on a consistent
basis - that is, perhaps, 1 algorithm or data structure per week, say. But the beauty of what I am
saying is that this need not be in depth! You only need to be able to reason about the algorithm,
perhaps write it out once, store it somewhere (I like to use Anki) and just move on with your life.
But the constant exposure to learning different algorithms is equivalent to working out the
'learning muscle'! Eventually, reasoning about new algorithms and these new ideas will be
much easier, will they not? And doesn't that imply that reasoning the algorithms in your
own problems within that small confined set of binary search, etc. will also get easier and easier?
Maybe this is already known: obviously, exposure to a wide variety of things will make you
smarter. But I think people don't take it literally enough and incorporate that aspect into
their daily lives / routine.

I would also say this isn't directly an algorithms based approach: those with more emotional
reasoning capacities also tend to have more friendships, and are exposed to many people and
different emotions. Someone who stays at home all day will probably have a weaker emotional
reasoning capacity. And I would call that your 'emotional intelligence'! I truly don't believe
someone who does go out and meet a lot of people, have a lot of deep conversations, and dealt
with tough emotional situations would keep the same capacity of reasoning as their previous
self - and is this not increasing your intelligence? Of course, this is targeted training. This is just
learning. But what about general intelligence? I think it's similar - you have to expose yourself
to a wide variety of general-intelligency-things: at least tailored towards what IQ test is
claiming to measure, anyways. I don't really care about general intelligence because it has
less practical use than intelligence in a certain field. Is this considered being knowledgable
instead of intelligence? Perhaps... although I would say going deep in a field would make you
knowledgable - going wide is more fruitful for intelligence, since this means your brain will naturally 
make connections and learning things easier since there's probably going to be something analagous
to it that you have experienced before. And probably improve the capacity to draw new connections for
things you have never experienced before! I think that's the subtle difference: although you will see,
all the intelligent people you know are often very knowledgable as well... for the exact same reason.

Now, how can you apply this to your daily lives? Well if you are studying programming,
it's exactly as I described above: spend a little bit of time (I would say, 10-20%)
learning new programming things! It can be very broad like a new programming language,
but also learning a new algorithm if you're more focused on competitive programming.
And don't get me wrong - I actually think most dedicated people are learning things
every week - but they are learning confined to what they actually do. For example,
someone trying to get good in C++ would not deepen their knowledge of niche C++ constructs,
but learn a bit of assembly, for example. Not saying niche C++ constructs aren't important,
you definitely need it: but save that for the 80% time, and spend the 20% time on something
else. 

On a more pure-intelligence level, I think one thing that is underrated is board games.
I also feel that is partially why the stereotypical 'nerdy' board game enthusiasts
also seem to have better logical reasoning skills. It's not quiiite the same as a 
chess prodigy who has only played chess their entire life. Regarding myself, I am planning to improve
by learning and playing a brand new board / card game every week during my spare time ("game days").
By learning a completely new system, and submerging myself in a completely new set of
rules, and having to reason about possible strategies to win at a basic level - I think it
will improve my capacity to learn and reason in the future. And as I progress,
I will get faster and sharper over time.

Anyways, that's all I really had to say - this piece has become a lot longer than
I had expected. I hope it gives you something interesting to think about, and
perhaps implement in your own life!

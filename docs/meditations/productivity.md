# Productivity

I am sure you, and many other people have at least consumed content teaching you
how to be more productive - whether it's a book to fix your habits, or a youtube
video telling you a "2-minute hack to stop procrastination". However, I feel as
though I am at a stage where I have come round circle. Sometimes, there is no
hack. Perhaps the only productivity advice you need is: 
- to sit down and do what you need to do. When your mind wanders, bring your attention back.
In the end, that is all that is necessary to complete your tasks. Every trick out there is
just trying to get you to do the above in a more roundabout way. 

We can also talk about learning efficiency and whatnot - but it boils down to: 
- Think deeply about whatever you are learning, and if you need to remember the details, then write it down and review it often.
There is of course more you can talk about with Bloom's taxonomy, spaced repetition, etc - but in the end,
if you think deeply about a problem and really try to understand how it connects with everything you are
learning, then that's 90% of the way there.

That's pretty much it. Of course, easier said than done - but there comes a point where
one should not get caught up so much in how to do it - and just do the task.

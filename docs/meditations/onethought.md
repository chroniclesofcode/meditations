# One Thought leads to a Hundred

> “Watch your thoughts, they become your words; watch your words, they become your actions; watch your actions, they become your habits; watch your habits, they become your character; watch your character, it becomes your destiny.”

Be careful of the power of one thought. One thought can lead to a hundred.
One negative thought can lead to a spiral of misery. One youtube
video can lead down a rabbit hole of hours.

But contrarily, one positive thought can lead to another. One thought to study
can lead to a decade of learning. One small act of kindness can lead to a lifetime
of friendship.

We must control our thoughts, because we are our thoughts. When a new thought
comes in, ask yourself: do I need this thought? If I let it linger for too long,
it may multiply exponentially into something unwanted.

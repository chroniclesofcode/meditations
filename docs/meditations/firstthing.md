# The First Step

I am not someone who has done great things (yet), nor am I a wisened elder with
a lifetime of experience. However, I would still like to give some thoughts on
what I think is required to be successful.

I think the first step someone should take if they wish to become someone successful,
or someone that achieves many great things in their lives, someone that changes the
world in some way - is to obtain drive, or in other words, an incredibly strong
motivation. I believe this is something that is able to be cultivated, and is not simply
reserved for a few lucky people who happen to obsess about something from an early age.

I suppose this is fairly obvious - it is very hard to do hard things if you don't have
the motivation for it. We are all goal driven creatures - it is very easy for us to
do something towards a goal, or something we like - and it's incredibly difficult to
be motivated towards something we don't have much feelings towards. Would I call someone
who struggles to pack boxes everyday for 6 hours undisciplined? I don't think so. I think
the first step to discipline is actually creating a strong target that underlies this discipline.
And that's why drive is important. Without a strong drive, discipline will waver, and without
self-control, it is hard to achieve great things. Every time we stray off the path, our
final destination should ideally bring us back towards the path.

However, I think people neglect this step too much - the goal forming process. They don't
flesh it out, really understand the roots of their desire, and build it up. If your drive
does not have stable foundations, it will crumble when the going gets tough. And that's why
it cannot be something superficial or temporary - think intrinsic vs extrinsic motivators.
That being said, I am a big believer of the 10x rule - whatever your goal is, 10x it.
I don't think an extrinsic motivator is necessarily bad, but I do think it will need to be
something big so that you are able to stay on the path for a long time. I also think it
helps if this thing is something core towards your identity, so that not striving towards
this goal is actually something that detracts from your own perception of self. I can
easily set a goal to make a billion dollars for myself - but that is not something that
I personally value and something I want to be core to who I am.

This sort of drive lends itself much better towards a large amount of 'self belief'. I think
it is vital to be optimistic (cautiously) - one must truly believe what they are doing
is special and important. I truly don't believe someone can achieve immense levels of success
whilst not believing in what they are doing. In addition, perhaps the definition of success
incorporates a bit of achieving something 'special and important'.

I also want to jump back to the topic of motivation. I did mention before that this drive
is a great source of motivation - but this is not what I truly believe about 'getting things
done'. You may have heard it before - motivation is actually a poor way of achieving your goals, 
since motivation is a feeling that comes and goes. One day you'll be motivated and the other day you won't.
People always say you need to be disciplined instead, but my argument is: what is it that you are
being disciplined for? There needs to be some sort of constant motivation behind it, and I guess that's what I call drive. 

But it's also fairly dangerous to think of using motivation to be disciplined. Let's say you
have distractions in front of you -
e.g. the obstacle of picking up your gaming device, or browsing reddit - this requires willpower/motivation
to overcome this obstacle and continue doing your work, but willpower is a finite resource. 
Eventually, you will run out and this will lead to non-discipline, or even worse, burnout.
I'm not going to go in-depth on how we can avoid these pitfalls - probably because I don't
even know the answer myself. My best guess is to eliminate distractions, and utilise
systems a.k.a creating powerful habits and sticking to them. It's fairly easy to stick to
a habit, and as a bonus you don't need to use willpower. But how many people stick to
their habits and systems consistently without a strong goal? But I digress.

I would take my words with a grain of salt - after all, these are the ramblings of a
university student. Perhaps my idea of success is completely wrong - and a peaceful
life in the countryside with family, a garden and friends is all it takes to live
happily (and successfully). Perhaps I will look back on these statements in a couple of years and see that
some of my ideas were wrong. However, I like to live my life with beliefs that are held
strongly, but open to change. I will follow my own advice unrelentlessly until I am proven wrong.

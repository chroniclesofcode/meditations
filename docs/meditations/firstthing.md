# The First Step

I am not someone who has done great things (yet), nor am I a wisened elder with
a lifetime of experience. However, I would still like to give some thoughts on
what I think is required to be successful.

I think the first step someone should take if they wish to become someone successful,
or someone that achieves many great things in their lives, someone that changes the
world in some way - is to obtain drive, or in other words, an incredibly strong
motivation. I believe this is something that is able to be cultivated, and is not simply
reserved for a few lucky people who happen to obsess about something from an early age.

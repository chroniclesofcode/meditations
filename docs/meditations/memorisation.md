# Memorisation

Recently, I've been very interested in the science of learning. I'm not going
to talk about all the details here, but one thing I found particularly noteworthy
was about your 'working memory'. 

So basically, you have your working memory (short-term...ish?) and long-term memory.
You can liken your working memory to RAM and your long term memory to your disk.
Every time you learn something, it first goes into your RAM, then your disk, much
like a modern computer. However, humans are very good at tricking themselves into
believing they have learnt something, when they haven't actually persisted that data
yet. You might say to yourself "oh this is so interesting, I'll probably never
forget this fact" - and then in a weeks time (and even worse, during an interview...),
you try so hard to recall this fact without success. I am going to assume this has
happened to everyone in some way or another.

So one thing every programmer can start to do (in my humble opinion) is really rely
on Anki, or any spaced repetition software. You can use it to persist really niche
things that sort-of pop up every now and then, but not often enough that you will
engage in the long-term memorisation process. 

I know a lot of people believe that good engineers don't need to memorise anything
since Google exists, or that coding up and applying their knowledge is the only way
to learn something. They definitely have arguments, but there are some things
that are just better to memorise. Perhaps it's a certain algorithm? Or maybe a slight
intricacy of a language/architecture. The moment something goes in my Anki - I already know
that piece of knowledge will be in my brain forever. And that's something very powerful.

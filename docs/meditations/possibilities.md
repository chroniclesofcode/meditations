# Possibilities

So recently, I have been getting into the board game Go/Weiqi/Baduk. If you don't
know what that is, a great website to check out would be `www.learn-go.net`. It's
an ancient board game which is similar-ish to Chess, but in my opinion, much more
deep and entertaining (I have also played my fair share of chess as well when I was younger).

Anyways, this article is not about Go. It's about opening your mind to many possibilities. The premise
of the game is incredibly simple - there are very few rules and can easily be
learnt in a couple of minutes - however, the more I play the game, the more I realise
the infinite amount of techniques, strategies and positions that can be realised
with just black and white pieces and a few extremely simple rules. And I start
to realise that in order to win more in Go, one has to open their mind to the infinite
possibilities at every juncture, and to consider single move you can play on the entire
board - one piece on one side can have subtle effects on the complete other side. 
The moment we close our mind to one door, that will be the door to victory.

And why I am writing this article is because this is a feeling that I have not
just felt when playing Go, but also when I am programming. Recently, when solving
questions on the various judges, I will inevitably encounter a question that I can't solve.
But after reading various solutions - it's almost never an algorithm that eludes me -
it's the fact that there are possibilities that I have never considered - really specific
ways to apply certain algorithms that never came up to me, finding the intricate links
between the data you have been given, and being so engrossed in one way to solve a problem,
I close all doors to other solutions.

Anyways, I'll keep it short. The moral of the story is... when pursuing anything that
really allows for freedom, creativity and high skill - mastery - it is important to keep an
open mind. An incredibly open mind. Consider all possibilities. Even if you consider
your mind to be open, you will be shocked how much more it can be. And that is why I love
learning a broad range of different technologies - it allows you to forever grow and
apply certain paradigms of one realm to another completely different area, and that
is where innovation lies.

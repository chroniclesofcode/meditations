# Writing a Blog

If you are here, it means you are reading my 'blog'. The purpose of my blog is
to record down my speculations on the workings of life. I often found myself
thinking of something, not writing it down, and being unable to fully recall
what I was thinking about a week later. That being said, I am not completely
new to the world of thought-writing - for a significant proportion of my life
I always kept a diary by my side - the day started with a checklist, and I would
also wrote entries on things I thought were interesting, much like this blog.
However, I decided to publish it online to not only force myself to maintain
a higher quality of writing, but also for other people to read perhaps in the
far future, to not only entertain but also enlighten.

If you haven't started writing something, I wholeheartedly believe you should.
I can't describe the exact reason, but I think it's beautiful to keep a permanent
record of some of your thoughts and theories throughout the years, as well as
revealing to other people what you are passionate about and how you view the world.
I have seen and read the blogs of many great ("successful") people, and I think it
is fascinating to understand what they are thinking - we all view the world in
completely different ways with completely different experiences, and by reading
the experiences of others, you can amass a lot of wisdom that will surpass the
possibilities of your current lifetime by many times. 

It doesn't necessarily have to be a blog, I suppose. I think writing about something
you are passionate about is all that it takes. I just happen to like thinking about
my own inner thoughts and how I approach life, if that makes sense. I know a lot of
greats of the ancient world not only kept diaries, but also wrote many many papers
and textbooks or whatnot. And through these records, we have built our foundations
of math and science upon. And yet, many people in this world do not embark on a journey
to write books (or things in general) - I think it's a shame. 

You don't need to be an incredibly accomplished
person to write something - perhaps you just have a unique perspective on life, or
a skill that you think you can contribute towards. If it's not enough for a book,
then leave it in a short blog. Perhaps someone in the future will use your writings
to inspire themselves, and improve themselves. Perhaps the writing will improve yourself
instead of others (after all, philosophers can only improve by thinking and writing...). 
Who knows? This article probably took me about 20-or-so minutes to
write, but will last for the rest of my life. And perhaps many people down the line
will read this article, and decide to start writing as well - I think that's beautiful.
And just maybe, you can be the first to pick up the pen and paper because of this article.

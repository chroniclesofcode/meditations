# Awareness is Self-Control

Awareness of your own actions, awareness of the conflicts within you - that is the
key to self control. 

Every time we take an action that goes against our own wishes of discipline - e.g. picking up that
phone and browsing social media, or eating sugary foods despite being on a diet - 
the internal part of your brain which monitors internal conflict has given up. That is why
most of these actions don't even feel like rational decisions and more like impulsive movements - you have turned off the
conflict monitoring portion of your brain. As long as you keep debating on the quality
of your actions and understanding the rationale behind each action you take - you will
have self control.

Meditation is a powerful tool to improve this aspect of your life - you are sitting there
breathing - and aware of your mind, your thoughts - and you are consciously bringing your
thoughts back onto your breath. This is the very muscle of self-control, and like all
muscles, can be trained.

I have recently watched a show called Frieren: Beyond Journey's End - in this show, the main
character perfectly conceals and suppresses the fluctuations of her magical power
for milennia - a task deemed by the show as requiring an incredible amount of concentration and focus - yet she has almost impossibly
mastered this skill to be doing it subconsciously 24/7, only revealing her true power when facing
formidable enemies. Every time a villain discovers her power was over 100x than what it seemed
on the surface, they are immensely shocked as this feat is virtually impossible.
I like to parallelise this technique to that of your internal conflict
resolution - every waking moment, we should monitor all the thoughts and desires that
come into our mind. The thoughts and desires of distraction and impulse. We must shut them
down as quickly as they arise, and over time, this action will be near subconscious and we
will finally be able to say we are in full control of our own self.

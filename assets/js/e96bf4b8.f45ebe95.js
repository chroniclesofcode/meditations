At least that's what I want to say. I've had a lot of opinions on this topic\nthroughout the years, usually just bouncing around from 'gaming is good' to\n'gaming is bad'. Personally, I have played my fair share of games - I've had\nwhole days where I just sat and played games. However, I wouldn't say I had a gaming\naddiction since I only played on off-days such as school holidays and I was always\nable to do what needed to be done."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"However today, you will hear my argument on why gaming is a bad thing. First of all,\nI will define gaming as strictly video games - board games such as chess, monopoly,\ncodenames or whatever don't count, because they are either much less addictive, or\nthey are social 'games' which I perceive to offset the downside."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"I also know there is a huge camp of people which are firm believers of 'time you\nenjoy wasting is not wasted time'. I used to be one of these people, but I am\nleaning toward the idea I was just making excuses for my past habit of gaming.\nMy general perspective is: enjoyment alone\nis not really enough to justify an activity. I put gaming in the same category as\ndrinking alcohol, or having fast food. They are generally unhealthy activities (the\nlatter for your body, the former for your mind), and sure it may be fine to do\nonce in a while, but you're probably better off quitting in general."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"I think the big argument for me is definitely opportunity cost - instead of gaming,\nthere are many things one can do, especially since gaming is a fairly time consuming\nhobby. You could go for a walk, talk with family and friends, go outside play some sport,\nlearn a new skill, practice a hobby - even creating a game is much better spend of time!\nThese are also enjoyable, but have tangible benefits towards your life as well, whether\nphysically or socially. A big gripe I have with things like watching TV/movies is that\nunless it was a truly standout movie (which can be an exception), it will be something\njust forgotten in a day to a month. It won't really contribute to your life, and it's\nas if that time just vanished. Same goes for scrolling social media. And same goes for\ngaming - if you have ever played a competitive FPS game, there is a good chance that\n99% of matches you have played are gone from your memory except for the standout\nmatches where you performed very well, for example. When I look back, I sometimes wonder\nhow crazy I would be at basketball, or even math, if I exchanged my gaming time to\nhone my skills (which obviously is unrealistic, but even 50% of the exchange would already\nbe a significant change). There's a lot more arguments along these lines, but I think\nyou understand the general idea. I want to spend my life working hard, improving every\naspect of myself and being a good person. Gaming is something that takes time away\nfrom these goals."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"From this whole article (and my blog), it is easy to tell that I am someone who\ncares a lot about being productive (god forbid...), but I really don't like\ndriving the argument towards that. I genuinely don't think that \"oh we need to be\nso productive every second of the day\", because it is important to take time and\nrelax - living like that is very stressful. I do think being efficient with your\nactions is important - so the time spent studying, for example, should be spent\nstudying and having your mind wander off to something else, going on a long detour\nand coming back to studying is a waste of time. "),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"This is where I think gaming is a bit of a problem. This is purely anecdotal, and\nI have no idea if it's the same for other people (but as long as it's real for me\nthen that's good enough technically), but gaming also takes a lot more time than\nthe physical act of gaming. For a surface level argument - gaming is tiring. It\nis much easier to study for 8 hours, then game for 8 hours instead of game for\n8 hours, then study for 8 hours. I believe it's because video games are inherently\na very dopaminergic activity - and game developers, as with social media developers,\nspend much of their time trying to make their game as addictive as possible - to\nobviously drive revenue. It saps away at a lot of energy, and if you must game, it\nis probably best to do it late at night when you are already tired. "),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"My most pressing issue with gaming is that, shortly after a gaming session, my mind\nis very often buzzing with games. I'm thinking of new strategies, or things that\nI want to try in my next session. And it's purely with gaming that these sort of\nthoughts pop up. Sure, if I play chess, I may have thoughts along these lines for\na while, but they much less intrude on the tasks I am doing. Perhaps I am studying,\nand suddenly (for god knows what reason), I have an urge to go play some games -\nand it requires some sort of willpower to bring myself back. And using that willpower\ndoes exert some energy, and makes studying much more difficult than it should be.\nI think the solution for this is along the lines of meditation and embracing boredom,\nbut I'll leave these topics for another day. But my concern is that gaming takes prime\nreal estate in my brain, real estate I would much rather give to something more deserving."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Anyways, I think I wrote too much - so I'll end it here.

I actually really\nenjoy gaming - I'd argue some of the best times of my life were actually spent inside\na game (both multiplayer and singleplayer games). However, it's just coming to a point\nwhere I'm starting to understand the value of time, and the fact that life is short.\nI have an extremely long list of things I want to achieve, so naturally I have to\nelminate every distraction down to the last one, which means gaming is something\nI need to part with.

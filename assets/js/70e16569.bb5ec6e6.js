Every time a villain discovers her power was over 100x than what it seems\non the surface, they are immensely shocked as this feat is virtually impossible.\nI like to parallelise this technique to that of your internal conflict\nresolution - every waking moment, we should monitor all the thoughts and desires that\ncome into our mind.

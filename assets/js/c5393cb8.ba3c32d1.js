I believe this is something that is able to be cultivated, and is not simply\nreserved for a few lucky people who happen to obsess about something from an early age."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"I suppose this is fairly obvious - it is very hard to do hard things if you don't have\nthe motivation for it. We are all goal driven creatures - it is very easy for us to\ndo something towards a goal, or something we like - and it's incredibly difficult to\nbe motivated towards something we don't have much feelings towards. Would I call someone\nwho struggles to pack boxes everyday for 6 hours undisciplined? I don't think so. I think\nthe first step to discipline is actually creating a strong target that underlies this discipline.\nAnd that's why drive is important. Without a strong drive, discipline will waver, and without\nself-control, it is hard to achieve great things. Every time we stray off the path, our\nfinal destination should ideally bring us back towards the path."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"However, I think people neglect this step too much - the goal forming process. They don't\nflesh it out, really understand the roots of their desire, and build it up. If your drive\ndoes not have stable foundations, it will crumble when the going gets tough. And that's why\nit cannot be something superficial or temporary - think intrinsic vs extrinsic motivators.\nThat being said, I am a big believer of the 10x rule - whatever your goal is, 10x it.\nI don't think an extrinsic motivator is necessarily bad, but I do think it will need to be\nsomething big so that you are able to stay on the path for a long time. I also think it\nhelps if this thing is something core towards your identity, so that not striving towards\nthis goal is actually something that detracts from your own perception of self. I can\neasily set a goal to make a billion dollars for myself - but that is not something that\nI personally value and something I want to be core to who I am."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"This sort of drive lends itself much better towards a large amount of 'self belief'. I think\nit is vital to be optimistic (cautiously) - one must truly believe what they are doing\nis special and important.

In addition, perhaps the definition of success\nincorporates a bit of achieving something 'special and important'."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"I also want to jump back to the topic of motivation. I did mention before that this drive\nis a great source of motivation - but this is not what I truly believe about 'getting things\ndone'. You may have heard it before - motivation is actually a poor way of achieving your goals,\nsince motivation is a feeling that comes and goes. One day you'll be motivated and the other day you won't.\nPeople always say you need to be disciplined instead, but my argument is: what is it that you are\nbeing disciplined for? There needs to be some sort of constant motivation behind it, and I guess that's what I call drive. "),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"But it's also fairly dangerous to think of using motivation to be disciplined. Let's say you\nhave distractions in front of you -\ne.g. the obstacle of picking up your gaming device, or browsing reddit - this requires willpower/motivation\nto overcome this obstacle and continue doing your work, but willpower is a finite resource.\nEventually, you will run out and this will lead to non-discipline, or even worse, burnout.\nI'm not going to go in-depth on how we can avoid these pitfalls - probably because I don't\neven know the answer myself. My best guess is to eliminate distractions, and utilise\nsystems a.k.a creating powerful habits and sticking to them. It's fairly easy to stick to\na habit, and as a bonus you don't need to use willpower. But how many people stick to\ntheir habits and systems consistently without a strong goal? But I digress."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"I would take my words with a grain of salt - after all, these are the ramblings of a\nuniversity student. Perhaps my idea of success is completely wrong - and a peaceful\nlife in the countryside with family, a garden and friends is all it takes to live\nhappily (and successfully). Perhaps I will look back on these statements in a couple of years and see that\nsome of my ideas were wrong. However, I like to live my life with beliefs that are held\nstrongly, but open to change.

Because of this, I have always been somewhat sceptical\nof the supposed benefits of early rising - or perhaps I didn't want to believe it\nsince I am not an early riser myself. However, studies show that early risers tend\nto perform better academically, as well as having high levels of physical and mental\nhealth.

We also get exposed to sunlight\nfor longer, keeping our alertness levels awake. Perhaps when the sun goes down, our\nnatural body tends to quieten down as well, since we are preparing for sleep.\nI haven't looked too much deeper into the studies, but all I can say for sure is - if I wake earlier,\nlife can only get better."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"I am also not much of a believer in the early bird and night owl. Some people are avid\nbelievers in the different sleep chronotypes - but I have changed my sleep schedule\ndramatically throughout my life, with little to no difference at all. In high-school I believed\nI was an early-bird, rising at around 6am every morning. But in university, I woke\nregularly at noon! And when I started working a 9-5, I gradually woke at 7:30-8am.\nThe transition periods were definitely uncomfortable - I truly believed I was not built\nto wake early during my university days - but once I got used to my\nschedule - my alertness and productivity levels have not changed much, at least\nfrom a subjective standpoint. If I had to examine myself under a microscope, perhaps\nmy high-school days were the most productive - I really got a lot done back then.\nBut it is hard to say whether that was because of the school system or my early mornings. But\nI do attribute some of my high-school results to the fact I arrived at school before 8am everyday\nand did an hour of study before class started at 9.

Night time is all about\nrelaxing, and it's hard to stop relaxing when your day time has been busy and stressful.\nI'll stop my stream-of-consciousness here - I just wanted to write a bit on early mornings and\nperhaps give you, the reader, a little nudge (and myself!).\nI think it's something many people aspire towards, but few people actually have the commitment\nto do it - maybe because we don't truly believe in the benefits. I think I'll start waking\nearlier from now on. And perhaps this day will be the starting point of great achievements to come."))}h.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);

However, I have an\ninteresting theory that may or may not be correct, but it is how I view one of the\nmany different facets of intelligence. Of course, since I am a computer scientist,\nI am more curious about the algorithmic/logical thinking types of intelligence, so\nbear that in mind."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"I'll cut straight to the chase: I think improving intelligence is a matter of\nbreadth and depth. There is a Goldilock's zone for this: too much depth makes you\nunable to make connections between different fields, and too much breadth makes\nyou unable to think about problems on a complex level. I think 99% of the population\ndoesn't have enough breadth in their work, and that is why it's observed that\nintelligence seems to remain stagnant after a certain age. People entering the workforce\ntend to not entertain breadth as much, and instead focus entirely on what their\noccupation requires. Years of education are deeply correlated with intelligence:\nand for good reason - where else can you learn such a variety of different subjects,\nat an in-depth level in such a short time? Especially at university, I am juggling\nan extremely large variety of different CS and Math courses per year, from linear algebra,\nto C++ systems to Javascript frontends. Now, let me backtrack and elaborate from the beginning."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"I've always been fairly good at sports when I was younger - especially sports I've\nnever played before - I was actually pretty good at them from the get-go. In other\nwords, I would say that I had a high \"sports-intelligence\" - and I attribute that\nto the fact that I've just played tons and tons of sports when I was younger such as\nbasketball, squash, table-tennis, tennis, soccer, baseball, running, swimming, volleyball,\noz-tag - and for each one I have invested at least 100 hours, and thousands for my\nfavourites. And I was pretty good when I was playing sports which were considered\nfairly different to the above. And you may be thinking: that's obvious - a lot of sports\nshare similar techniques, such as racket-handling, or agility, or throwing a ball.\nAnd that's exactly the point I want to make."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Just as person who have learnt a lot of different 'techniques' from learning sports,\nI believe the same is for algorithmic thinking. Someone who has learnt and implemented\ntons and tons of algorithms is going to pick up and apply new algorithms better than\npeople who are an expert in a select few. The common discourse in competitive programming is:\nto reach a certain \"low\" rank, one must focus on the fundamental algorithms deeply since\nall the problems are just applications of it: think binary search, dp, graph, factorizations.\nSo tons of newbies set out and only solve problems in a confined context. I used to think the\nsame. But now, I think people who are trying to improve must learn new algorithms on a consistent\nbasis - that is, perhaps, 1 algorithm or data structure per week, say. But the beauty of what I am\nsaying is that this need not be in depth! You only need to be able to reason about the algorithm,\nperhaps write it out once, store it somewhere (I like to use Anki) and just move on with your life.\nBut the constant exposure to learning different algorithms is equivalent to working out the\n'learning muscle'! Eventually, reasoning about new algorithms and these new ideas will be\nmuch easier, will they not? And doesn't that imply that reasoning the algorithms in your\nown problems within that small confined set of binary search, etc. will also get easier and easier?\nMaybe this is already known: obviously, exposure to a wide variety of things will make you\nsmarter. But I think people don't take it literally enough and incorporate that aspect into\ntheir daily lives / routine."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"I would also say this isn't directly an algorithms based approach: those with more emotional\nreasoning capacities also tend to have more friendships, and are exposed to many people and\ndifferent emotions. Someone who stays at home all day will probably have a weaker emotional\nreasoning capacity. And I would call that your 'emotional intelligence'! I truly don't believe\nsomeone who does go out and meet a lot of people, have a lot of deep conversations, and dealt\nwith tough emotional situations would keep the same capacity of reasoning as their previous\nself - and is this not increasing your intelligence? Of course, this is targeted training. This is just\nlearning. But what about general intelligence? I think it's similar - you have to expose yourself\nto a wide variety of general-intelligency-things: at least tailored towards what IQ test is\nclaiming to measure, anyways. I don't really care about general intelligence because it has\nless practical use than intelligence in a certain field. Is this considered being knowledgable\ninstead of intelligence? Perhaps... although I would say going deep in a field would make you\nknowledgable - going wide is more fruitful for intelligence, since this means your brain will naturally\nmake connections and learning things easier since there's probably going to be something analagous\nto it that you have experienced before. And probably improve the capacity to draw new connections for\nthings you have never experienced before! I think that's the subtle difference: although you will see,\nall the intelligent people you know are often very knowledgable as well... for the exact same reason."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Now, how can you apply this to your daily lives? Well if you are studying programming,\nit's exactly as I described above: spend a little bit of time (I would say, 10-20%)\nlearning new programming things! It can be very broad like a new programming language,\nbut also learning a new algorithm if you're more focused on competitive programming.\nAnd don't get me wrong - I actually think most dedicated people are learning things\nevery week - but they are learning confined to what they actually do. For example,\nsomeone trying to get good in C++ would not deepen their knowledge of niche C++ constructs,\nbut learn a bit of assembly, for example. Not saying niche C++ constructs aren't important,\nyou definitely need it: but save that for the 80% time, and spend the 20% time on something\nelse. "),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"On a more pure-intelligence level, I think one thing that is underrated is board games.\nI also feel that is partially why the stereotypical 'nerdy' board game enthusiasts\nalso seem to have better logical reasoning skills. It's not quiiite the same as a\nchess prodigy who has only played chess their entire life. Regarding myself, I am planning to improve\nby learning and playing a brand new board / card game every week during my spare time (\"game days\").\nBy learning a completely new system, and submerging myself in a completely new set of\nrules, and having to reason about possible strategies to win at a basic level - I think it\nwill improve my capacity to learn and reason in the future. And as I progress,\nI will get faster and sharper over time."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Anyways, that's all I really had to say - this piece has become a lot longer than\nI had expected.

It's about opening your mind to many possibilities. The premise\nof the game is incredibly simple - there are very few rules and can easily be\nlearnt in a couple of minutes - however, the more I play the game, the more I realise\nthe infinite amount of techniques, strategies and positions that can be realised\nwith just black and white pieces and a few extremely simple rules. And I start\nto realise that in order to win more in Go, one has to open their mind to the infinite\npossibilities at every juncture, and to consider single move you can play on the entire\nboard - one piece on one side can have subtle effects on the complete other side.\nThe moment we close our mind to one door, that will be the door to victory."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"And why I am writing this article is because this is a feeling that I have not\njust felt when playing Go, but also when I am programming. Recently, when solving\nquestions on the various judges, I will inevitably encounter a question that I can't solve.\nBut after reading various solutions - it's almost never an algorithm that eludes me -\nit's the fact that there are possibilities that I have never considered - really specific\nways to apply certain algorithms that never came up to me, finding the intricate links\nbetween the data you have been given, and being so engrossed in one way to solve a problem,\nI close all doors to other solutions."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Anyways, I'll keep it short. The moral of the story is... when pursuing anything that\nreally allows for freedom, creativity and high skill - mastery - it is important to keep an\nopen mind. An incredibly open mind. Consider all possibilities. Even if you consider\nyour mind to be open, you will be shocked how much more it can be. And that is why I love\nlearning a broad range of different technologies - it allows you to forever grow and\napply certain paradigms of one realm to another completely different area, and that\nis where innovation lies."))}m.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
